# Grafos

## Description

This project is an implementation of various graph search algorithms, developed as part of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms discipline.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   \```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sofiarovaris/Grafos.git
   \```

2. Compile and run the Java program.

3. Choose the desired algorithm from the menu to perform operations on the inserted graph.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses a graph in a depthward motion.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses a graph in a breadthward motion.
- **Bellman-Ford**: Finds the shortest path in a graph with negative edge weights.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
